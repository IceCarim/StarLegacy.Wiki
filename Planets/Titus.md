**Description**

Titus is a radioactive planet located in the innermost orbital of the Centrum solar system. Its surface is made up of mainly purple and green terracotta. 
Due to the planet's harsh conditions and constant ticking sound caused by the radiation, it is viewed by most to be an undesirable habitat and thus there is a low permanent population on the planet.
